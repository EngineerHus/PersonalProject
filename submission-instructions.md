# Unit/Final Project Submission Instructions

1. Make sure you have a GitHub account on GA's GitHub enterprise platform https://git.generalassemb.ly/

2. Create a new **private** repo for your projects on the website. Give it an sensible name such as 'YOUR INITALS-projects' https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo

3. Make myself a collaborator to this repo (I will get an email invite). https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository

4. **Either** use the git software (bonus points ;p) **or** the button on the website to upload your projects https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/adding-a-file-to-a-repository

5. We will head to your repo to check out your projects :)
